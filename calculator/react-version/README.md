## Step 1: Set Up a New React App
First, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-calculator
cd my-calculator
```

This will create a new React application called **my-calculator**.

## Step 2: Create the Calculator Component
We'll create a Calculator component that mirrors your existing HTML structure:
- `src/Calculator.js`
- `src/Calculator.css`
- `src/App.js`

## Step 3: Run the Application
Save all your files and run:

```bash
npm start
```

Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your React calculator in action!
